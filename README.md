# Natours

This repo contains the files for a project that is part of the Udemy course:
> Advanced CSS and SASS: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!  
by Jonas Schmedtmann  

The Natours (on-line travel agency specializing in nature tours) project is an exercise in creating a single-page, responsive web-app using advanced HTML, CSS 
and node.js for it's development.  It was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann for demonstrating the use of GRID in positioning sections and 
elements on a page.   

This repo contains my most recent version of this website which was built using SASS, node.js and a float grid system for page layout.

In addition to the course material I used the following in my development process:

- Gimp 2.10 for image importing/manipulation
- Inkscape 0.92 for svg creation
- Codepen for testing grid layouts and various other ideas

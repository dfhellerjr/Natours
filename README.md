# Natours

This repo contains the files for a project that is part of the Udemy course:
> Advanced CSS and SASS: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!  
by Jonas Schmedtmann  

The Natours (on-line travel agency specializing in nature tours) project is an exercise in creating a single-page, responsive web-app using advanced HTML, CSS and node.js for it's development.  It was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann for demonstrating the use of the CSS grid layout in positioning sections and elements on a page.

This repo contains my most recent version of this website which was built using SASS, node.js and a responsive grid system for page layout.

In addition to the course material I used the following in my development process:

- Gimp 2.10 for image importing/manipulation
- Inkscape 0.92 for svg creation
- Codepen for testing grid layouts and various other ideas
